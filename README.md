# the Harry Potter mod
The Harry Potter mod is a mod designed to add in all of the features from the book series into the game Minecraft. 
This mod is nowhere near done as the series contains many features that are nessecary to the plot.
This mod is made using MCreator, and a great thanks to the developers of the following plugins:

**Goldfuscate**

**Caelus API**

**Curios API**

**File Manager**

**Push**

**Downloading**

**MCreator** (Although it's not really a plugin is it?)

Also thanks to MrCrayfish for making the **Obfuscate** library that is imported by the plugin **Goldfuscate**. There would barely be any animation without it.
Hogwarts is not included in the mod and should be either built or downloaded by you.
To major dissapointment, MCreator does not have the ability to make a model of a type such as a train, so the Hogwarts Express is out of the game.
If you want to have a Hogwarts Express, download the mods **Immersive Engineering**, **Immersive Petroleum** and **Immersive Railroading**.
There are several items in the mod which are only there for icon purposes, these items are unobtainable, and if you try to give it to yourself through commands, it will be instantaneously deleted. The maximum stack size for them is also set to zero, so don't even try.
If you do not have MCreator and do not want to install it, inside of the jmd folder, the jar mod stays, this jar mod is updated daily, so if needed, download it from there.
